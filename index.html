                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>From psychology to tech</h3>
                <p>I initially trained and worked as a psychologist for over a decade before deciding to pursue my
                    passion for tech.</p>
                <p>Whilst still working as a psychologist I have started my first tech adjacent job
                    as a technical writer with <a href="http://www.finocomp.com/" target="_blank">FinoComp</a>.</p>
                <p>I am also currently
                    completing a
                    <a href="http://futurestudents.csu.edu.au/courses/technology-computing-maths/master-information
                    -technology-12" target="_blank"> Masters of Information Technology specialising in Software
                        Development and Design </a> with Charles Sturt University.</p>
                <h3>Programming skills</h3>
                <p>When it comes to programming, I have skills in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and developing
                    apps with Android Studio.</p>
                <h3>Human perspective</h3>
                <p>I bring from my decades experience as a psychologist an understanding of people which has allowed me
                    a particular insight into how best to make software products usable for customers.</p>
                <h3>Tech Writing</h3>
                <p>I have extensive experience producing written content for a variety of purposes in the psychology
                    space including; medico-legal reports, training resources, policy and procedure, and journal
                    articles. I have recently started work where I have been fortunate to port these technical writing
                    skills to the field of software documentation.</p>
